    <h1>My Journey</h1>

    <p>
        I was born in Alwar, Rajasthan. My family later moved to Sikar due to my father's job,
        then lived in Kota for several years, and finally shifted back to Jaipur in 2021.
        After living in a rented place, we bought our own penthouse. I’m currently studying in Jaipur
        and building my career through hard work, consistency, and daily discipline.
    </p>

    <p>
        My goal is to secure an on-site internship in Bangalore or Hyderabad during my semester break
        and become fully financially independent. Every day is a step toward that life.
